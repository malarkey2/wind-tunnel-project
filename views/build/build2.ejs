            <ul>
                <li>Download and view the full scale plan of the section component you are building first. If you have the resources to
                     plot/print the full scale non-tiled sheet, go ahead and print this file and head to Step #03.</li>
                <li>If you cannot print this, go to the tiled scheme and print the entire document single-sidedly. </li>

            <h2>Step #02 - Layout Tiled Sheet</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>After printing the tiled document, arrange it like the layout you see in the cover page of the tiled plan.
                     The numbers represent the page numbers of the tiled A4 sheets.</li>
                <li>You will notice that there is some whitespace as you’re aligning them.
                     Cut the sheet along its crosshairs on the corners and arrange them. </li>
                <li>Once they’re arranged, stick the edges together with transparent plastic tape. This would stitch the tiles into the full scale sheet.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Step #03 - Place and Cut</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Place the full scale sheet onto the cardboard/foamboard. Make sure the board’s length and breadth are large enough to accomodate the full sheet.
                     If you weren’t able to scavenge a large enough sheet, you can use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-29UC4NTdPU" target="_blank">this method</a> to make your board bigger.</li>
                <li>Secure the sheet onto the board using thumb-pins and tape - make sure it doesn’t move.
                     The Drawing Key at the corner of the page indicates the meaning of the diagram elements. </li>
                <li>Carefully cut along the correct lines on the sheet. We recommend using a box-cutter and a ruler. The method is best depicted in <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Cut-Thick-Cardboard" target="_blank">this guide</a>.
                </li>

            <h2>Step #04 - Join Cut-Out Pieces</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Once you’ve cut all pieces for a section, join them together with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UofY6lOQ-q0" target="_blank">hot glue</a>. The best method is to apply an appropriate amount on the specified areas on the plan sheet - glueline.</li>
                <li>Hold the piece at a right angle (90°) until the hot glue cools down.</li>
                <li>Stick the sides to the base and then stick the hood to the sides. You will end up with a strong section frame for the wind tunnel.
