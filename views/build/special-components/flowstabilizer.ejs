            <h2>Step 01 - Cutting Straws</h2>
            <p>
               Cut up straws of a 4mm diameter into pieces of length 30mm. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UouMzsKyYm0" target="_blank">paper guillotine</a> can help quicken the process, but scissors would also work. 
               Lining them up and marking them with a marker for 30mm (3cm) would ensure evenly-sized pieces. 
               Each 24" diameter requires about 150 pieces. 
            </p>
            <h2>Step 02 - Row-wise Taping</h2>
            <p>Arrange the 3cm pieces in a single row that runs 24 inches long. Use a ruler (or even push them against a wall) to line them up in an even straight line. <br>
            once they're lined up, use any ordinary tape to fix them.</p>

            <h2>Step 03 - Stacking the Straw Rows</h2>
            <p>After you've taped up a row of straws, stack it into the honeycomb frame. You needn't fasten it with tape. The packing force will push against the wall and hold the honeycomb in place.</p>
            

            <h2>Step 04 - Repeat Steps 1-3</h2>
            <p>Repeat this process till the entire frame is filled with straw rows.</p>

            <h2>Step 01 - Procuring Compoents</h2>
            <p>Since these are electronic equipments, review the specs available in the table above.</p>

            <h2>Step 02 - Mounting the Motor</h2>
            <p><ul>
                <li>Cut a piece of ply. insert specs</li>
                <li>trace the motor mount's holes on in the midde of the wooden strip.</li>
                <li>drill the marked holes. The center must allow the rod to spin freely</li>
                <li>Screw the motor in</li>
            </ul></p>

            <h2>Step 03 - Joining the electronics and securing them</h2>
            <p> no wire should be in line of a spinning motor</p>

            <h2>step 04</h2>
