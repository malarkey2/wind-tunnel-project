            <h1>Wind Tunnel Build</h1>
            <p>This build is specifically designed to aid the lack of accessibility of tools and reseources. Nevertheless, some effort is required to build the windtunnel we’ve optimised.
                The build is divided into two main components: the frame and the special components. 
                
                The frame is the body of the windtunnel - the method for building which is common throughout the sections and is mentioned <a href="#frame-method">below</a>. It starts with a blueprint anyone can print and 
                ends with a sturdy frame ready to house your aerodynamic ideas. 

                The special components include the honeycomb, power-pod, etc. Methods for these are different and are addressed appropriately below. 
                Before that though, we build the frame.

            <h2>Wind Tunnel Frame - Build Plan</h2>
            <p>Building the frame is a fairly simple process. It starts with a printable blueprint plan, which you will use to trace and cut the components of the wind tunnel sections. The cardboard (or foamboard) pieces are joined together, which forms a the 
                windtunnel. Besides this, only a few components remain to have a completely functional windtunnel.</p>

            <p>After cutting each of the section’s sides on the 2D board, we join them to form the 3D figure. Exactly like the adjacent image, where the 2D squares are cut and stuck at right angles from each other to form a 3D cube. 
                <br> <br>
                Now, the 2D shapes required to build the 3D sections of the windtunnel aren’t easy to make. This is why the full scale plans for each section are provided in the build plan below. 
                
                Some of the dimensions of the pieces, however, are several inches larger and wider than the A4 sheet size, and only fit on A1 sheets.
                <br>
                To make this accessible to everyone, though, the option of joining A4 sheets to stitch together the full-scale diagram is facilitated in the build plans. The steps from printing to building all the section frames are common in procedure. They are as follows:
