        <h2>Project Cost</h2>
        <p>The primary aim of this project was to make the windtunnel accessible to as many people as possible. The project is constantly working towards reducing costs, bettering designs, and optimising acccesibility parameters.
            As a result of that mission, today we stand at the figures mentioned below. We strive to continue getting better.
