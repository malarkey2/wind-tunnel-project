        Project's Use Case
    </p>
    <p>
        A wind-tunnel is a large tube-like apparatus that replicates the interaction between air and object moving through air. Wind tunnels have been around since the 18th century and are still important to analyse aerodynamic interactions. 

Despite advanced computational software (CFD), hours of wind tunnel testing are still essential to the prototyping process. Designed to benefit all enthusiasts, <em>the Wind Tunnel Project</em> strives to inspire the spirit of research in aerodynamics. 
The first step to furthering academic inquisitiveness in the subject is reliable analysis. The wind tunnel would allow you to study aerodynamic interactions, creating a strong foundation for any work in the subject.
